Udacity's Foundation Machine Learning Nanodegree This repo contains projects developed in Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree.

# Explore US Bikeshare Data
# Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data. If you are not familiar with the data analysis process, this project will be your first exposure to the kinds of steps that a data analyst takes when they approach a dataset. The steps of the process that you go through here will be covered in more depth as you continue on with the Nanodegree program. For now, all you need is the general programming skills you've learned from the "Introduction to Python Programming" course and a desire to learn about the data analysis process! Note that you may not have seen some of the packages used in the project prior to this point, so you should be comfortable with following documentation links and experimenting with code to build your intuition for how to use the packages to solve the problems posed.

# Stroop effect or Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
# Overview
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

# Investigate A Dataset
# Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

# Boston Housing
# Overview
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, youâ€™ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.
